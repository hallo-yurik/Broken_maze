  An unfinished game project that generates a maze, depending on the difficulty level you select. The game endlessly generates mazes, the beginning of which is the end of previous ones.
  The game has many critical bugs and flaws (including problems with collision), which is why its development is delayed indefinitely.
  You can only launch the game through the console with Python loaded and the Kivy library. To do this, run the findway.py file.
